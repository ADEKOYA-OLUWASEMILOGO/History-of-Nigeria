            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>The history of  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria">Nigeria</a> can be traced to settlers trading across the middle East and Africa as early as <span>1100 BC</span>. Numerous ancient African civilizations settled in the region that is known today as Nigeria, such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Nri">Kingdom of Nri</a>,the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benin_Empire">  Benin Empire</a>, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oyo_Empire">Oyo Empire</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_in_Nigeria">Islam reached Nigeria</a> through the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borno_Empire">Borno Empire</a>  between <span>(1068 AD)</span> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hausa_States">Hausa States</a> around<span> (1385 AD)</span> during the <span>11th century</span>, while <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity_in_Nigeria">Christianity came to Nigeria</a> in the<span> 15th century</span> through Augustinian and Capuchin monks from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_Empire">Portugal</a>. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songhai_Empire">Songhai Empire</a>  also occupied part of the region.

                <h4>    The history of Nigeria has been crucially impacted by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transatlantic_Slave_Trade">Transatlantic Slave Trade</a> ,which started in Nigeria in the late <span>15th century</span>. At first, Europeans captured people who lived along the coast. The first slave trading post used by the British and the Portuguese is Badagry , a coastal harbour. The chains where they tied up young and virile young people still stands today. Later, they used local brokers to provide them with slaves. This activity escalated conflicts among the different ethnic groups in the region and disrupted older trade patterns through the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans-Saharan_route">Trans-Saharan route</a>.</h4>
                    
                <h4><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagos">Lagos</a> was invaded by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Empire">British</a> forces in<span> 1851</span> and formally annexed in <span>1865</span>. Nigeria became a British protectorate in <span>1901 </span>while her colonization lasted until <span>1960</span>, when an independence movement succeeded in gaining her independence. Nigeria first became a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nigerian_Republic">republic</a> in <span>1963</span>, but succumbed to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigerian_military_juntas_of_1966%E2%80%9379_and_1983%E2%80%9399">military rule</a> three years later after a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1966_Nigerian_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat">bloody coup d'état</a>. A separatist movement later formed the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Biafra">Republic of Biafra</a>  in <span>1967</span>, leading to the three-year <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigerian_Civil_War">Nigerian Civil War</a> . Nigeria became a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Nigerian_Republic">republic </a> once again after a new constitution was written in<span> 1979</span>. However, the republic was short-lived, when the military <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1983_Nigerian_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat">seized power again</a>  for another four years. A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Nigerian_Republic"> new republic</a> was planned to be established in<span> 1993</span>, but was aborted by General <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sani_Abacha">Sani Abacha</a>. Abacha died in <span>1998</span> and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Nigerian_Republic">fourth republic</a>  was later established the following year, which ended three decades of intermittent military rule.</h4>

Notably, as First Speaker of the House, Jaja Wachuku received Nigeria's Instrument of Independence, also known as Freedom Charter, on <span> 1 October 1960</span>, from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Alexandra,_The_Honourable_Lady_Ogilvy">Princess Alexandra</a>  of Kent, the Queen's representative at the Nigerian independence ceremonies. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_II">Queen Elizabeth II was monarch of Nigeria and head of state</a> , and Nigeria was a member of the British <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Nations">Commonwealth of Nations</a> . The Federal government was given exclusive powers in defence, foreign relations, and commercial and fiscal policy. The monarch of Nigeria was still head of state but legislative power was vested in a bicameral parliament, executive power in a prime minister and cabinet, and judicial authority in a Federal Supreme Court. Political parties, however, tended to reflect the makeup of the three main ethnic groups.

The northern region of the country, consisting of three-quarters of the land area and more than half the population of Nigeria. Thus the North dominated the federation government from the beginning of independence. In the <span> 1959</span> elections held in preparation for independence, the NPC captured <span> 134</span> seats in the 312-seat parliament.</h4>

The party leadership under Awolowo disagreed and replaced Akintola as premier of the West with one of their own supporters. However, when the Western Region parliament met to approve this change, Akintola supporters in the parliament started a riot in the chambers of the parliament. Fighting between the members broke out. Chairs were thrown and one member grabbed the parliamentary Mace and wielded it like a weapon to attack the Speaker and other members. Eventually, the police with tear gas were required to quell the riot. In subsequent attempts to reconvene the Western parliament, similar disturbances broke out. Unrest continued in the West and contributed to the Western Region's reputation for, violence, anarchy and rigged elections. Federal Government Prime Minister Balewa declared martial law in the Western Region and arrested Awolowo and other members of his faction charged them with treason. Akintola was appointed to head a coalition government in the Western Region. Thus, the AG was reduced to an opposition role in their own stronghold.</h4>
